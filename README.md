# Ivy - a stupid discord bot
I wanted to make something funny that actually somewhat had a bit of use, so here.

## Requirements
Python 3.8+  
discord.py (latest)  
Somewhat of a brain

## Setup
Download the source code by using the BIG GREEN BUTTON that says CODE on it.  
You then need to click "Download ZIP" and then extract the folder somewhere.  
Then run "pip install discord" into the console (assuming you already have it tbh)  
After that, edit the config file with your keys & your preference, and there you go.

## Support
Fuck you
